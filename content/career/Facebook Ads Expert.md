We are looking for a talented Facebook Ads specialist to join our team.

We don't care how old are you, where you are from, what are your personal preferences, or what drives you. We want to cultivate a respective work place, where professional attitude matters the most. The only thing we care about is if you can take a job and deliver.

You don't have to have plenty of experience (but that helps). If you have skills, talent, and you feel a passion to create and optimize Facebook campaigns, and you can prove it, we are happy to talk to you.

### In this position, you will:

- research FB Ads target audiences using FB Audiences Insights
- configure Facebook Ads campaigns
- craft compelling creatives that convert
- manage multiple Facebook Ads campaigns via FB Ads Manager

### Requirements:

- expert in FB Ads strategy planning
- practical knowledge of research audiences using FB Audiences Insights
- practical knowledge of FB Ads campaigns and their optimization for ROI
- ability to be productive in the remote work environment

The salary depends on experience and productivity.

In Appdy, we all work remotely, so if you join our team, you will work remotely as well. We know that remote work is not for everyone, and it may be challenging. If you feel remote working is not for you, please do not apply.

This is a unique opportunity to join the Appdy team. If you think that this role is for you, don't hesitate to contact us.
