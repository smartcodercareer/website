### In this position, you will:

- work together with other developers and designers on building websites

The salary depends on experience and productivity.

In Appdy, we all work remotely, so if you join our team, you will work remotely as well. We know that remote work is not for everyone, and it may be challenging. If you feel remote working is not for you, please do not apply.

This is a unique opportunity to join the Appdy team. If you think that this role is for you, don't hesitate to contact us.
